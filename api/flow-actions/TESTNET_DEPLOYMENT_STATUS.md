# Flow Testnet Deployment Status

## Current Status
- **Account Address**: `0xdaac4c96b1ea362d`
- **Balance**: 100,000 FLOW tokens
- **Explorer**: https://testnet.flowscan.io/account/daac4c96b1ea362d

## Deployed Contracts
âœ… **ExampleConnectors** - Successfully deployed and verified on testnet

## Pending Deployments
The following contracts are ready for deployment but require proper key setup:
- SubscriptionVaults
- EVMBridgeMonitor  
- SubscriptionAutomation
- LayerZeroConnectors
- FlareFDCTriggers

## Key Configuration Issue
The testnet account has a public key mismatch preventing new deployments. The account shows:
- Public Key: `cadc9d9d9c487615c64b2766d9c385add7c71df9a0e33b10313e9d59b6e93b7b8e5dd17f41df69cd1723c174a68e57b4573d58e5f7e9d7c55025b5d907a255d6`
- Signature Algorithm: ECDSA_P256
- Hash Algorithm: SHA3_256

## Next Steps for Full Deployment
1. Obtain the correct private key that matches the public key on the testnet account
2. Or create a new testnet account with known keys
3. Deploy all subscription contracts
4. Run testnet demonstrations

## Working Features
Even without full deployment, the following can be demonstrated:
- Account exists with significant funding (100k FLOW)
- ExampleConnectors contract is deployed
- All contracts work on emulator
- Code is ready for production deployment
