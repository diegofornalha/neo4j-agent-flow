# üîß Storage Error Fix Guide

## Error Analysis

**Error Code**: 1103 - Storage Limit Exceeded  
**Account**: `486b45c0ba4c910d` (User's account)  
**Issue**: Account needs more FLOW tokens for storage capacity

## Understanding Flow Storage

In Flow blockchain:
- **Storage costs FLOW tokens** to maintain
- **1 FLOW ‚âà 100MB** of storage capacity
- **Subscription vaults** need ~5KB of storage
- **Minimum**: 0.001 FLOW for basic storage

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Add FLOW to User's Account ‚≠ê (Recommended)

The user needs to add FLOW to their wallet:

```
Account: 486b45c0ba4c910d
Needed: ~0.1 FLOW (to be safe)
Current: Insufficient for storage
```

**How to get FLOW:**
1. **Buy on Exchange**: Kraken, Binance, Coinbase
2. **Transfer to wallet**: Send to `486b45c0ba4c910d`
3. **Wait for confirmation**: 1-2 minutes
4. **Retry subscription creation**

### Option 2: Use Different Account

If the user has another Flow account with sufficient FLOW:
1. Switch to account with FLOW balance
2. Ensure it has >0.1 FLOW
3. Try creating subscription

### Option 3: Get FLOW from Faucet (Testnet Only)

**Note**: This only works on testnet, not mainnet!
```bash
# If this were testnet:
flow accounts fund 486b45c0ba4c910d --network testnet
```

## Frontend Integration

I've added a **StorageChecker component** that:
- ‚úÖ Checks storage capacity before creating subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Shows exact FLOW needed
- ‚úÖ Provides clear instructions
- ‚úÖ Prevents failed transactions

## Prevention

To prevent this error in the future:

1. **Pre-flight Checks**: Always check storage before transactions
2. **Minimum Balance**: Recommend users keep >0.1 FLOW
3. **Clear Instructions**: Guide users to buy FLOW first
4. **Error Handling**: Show storage errors clearly

## Storage Calculation

```
Storage Used: 4,137 bytes
Storage Capacity: 0 bytes (0 FLOW)
Storage Needed: ~5,000 bytes for subscription vault
FLOW Needed: 0.1 FLOW (safety margin)
```

## User Instructions

**For the user with account `486b45c0ba4c910d`:**

1. **Buy FLOW tokens** on any exchange (Kraken, Binance, etc.)
2. **Send 0.1 FLOW** to your wallet address: `486b45c0ba4c910d`
3. **Wait for confirmation** (1-2 minutes)
4. **Refresh the page** and check storage status
5. **Try creating subscription again**

## Technical Details

**Storage Formula in Flow:**
```
Storage Capacity (bytes) = FLOW Balance √ó 100MB
Required for Vault = ~5KB
Minimum FLOW = 0.00005 FLOW
Recommended = 0.1 FLOW (safety buffer)
```

## Status Check

After adding FLOW, the StorageChecker will show:
- ‚úÖ **Green**: Sufficient storage capacity
- ‚ùå **Red**: Still needs more FLOW

The subscription creation will be **automatically enabled** once storage is sufficient.

## Next Steps

1. **User adds FLOW** to their account
2. **Storage checker validates** capacity
3. **Subscription creation** proceeds normally
4. **Vault is stored** successfully on-chain
